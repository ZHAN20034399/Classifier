# Classifier
There are the codes of the article, 
Program name: MLP Classifier, RF classifier, SVM classifier.
This article provides code for the six classifiers trained based on two datasets, supplementary data 3 and supplementary data 4, each of which is divided into two parts. The first half builds the classifier based on "Supplementary data3.xlsx" and "Supplementary data4.xlsx", so in oder to make the codes run properly, do not make any changes on them
In the second half, readers can import their own excel data to use the classifier making new predictions. Need python environment and pandas and scikit-learn Libraris.
